## GITHUB

I refreshed my memory of Git commands and their purposes. I also refamiliarized myself with Visual Studio Code, and how to use Git commands through Source Control.

## AWS

My IP address is: 18.211.42.4
in order to ssh and use my key use ~/.ssh/production.pem
to deploy to my server use ./deployReact.sh -k ~/.ssh/production.pem -h auditapp.click -s startup


## Caddy

followed all the instructions. It worked perfectly.

## HTML

I structured out everything, but used an AI helper to quickly create my different fields i needed. It was almost instantaneous, I just had to change a few different areas of the code to fit my needs. I had trouble with getting the simon subdomain working.

## CSS

I enjoyed writing the css styling for my application. I made a basic scaffolding, and then asked AI for specific help to implement my ideas. think my end result looks really functional, but I'm excited to start using react and get a little more out of my webapp.

## React Part 1: Routing

Had to update class to className in my html. React components were easy to figure out. Hard to debug because of how precise you have to be.

## React Part 2: Reactivity

I'm excited to actually implement these technologies that will help my startup actually work well. It was fun to make a popup that does the websocket messages.
